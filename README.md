  Dot HQ Status Page <i>(status.dothq.co)</i>
</h1>

Welcome to the frontend side of the Dot HQ Status Page! Our pages are in `pages/`, the assets are at `src/images`.

_Have an idea for our website? You can drop a suggestion in our [Discord server](https://invite.gg/dot) or [create an issue in this repo](/issues/new)._

## 🚀 Running locally

1.  **Clone the repo**

    If you have [Git](https://git-scm.com) installed, this should be an easy task.

    ```shell
    # cloning our repo...
    git clone https://git.dothq.co/status
    ```

1.  **Install dependencies**

    We recommend using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) instead of [npm](https://npm.im), as npm causes issues with Gatsby.

    ```shell
    cd status
    yarn
    ```

1.  **Run the development server**

    Once all the dependencies have installed without errors, run the following commands in your terminal.

    ```shell
    yarn develop
    ```

1.  **Start hacking**

    You should see a message in the terminal like this:

    ```shell
    You can now view status in the browser.
    ⠀
      http://localhost:8000/
    ⠀
    View GraphiQL, an in-browser IDE, to explore your site's data and schema
    ⠀
      http://localhost:8000/___graphql
    ⠀
    Note that the development build is not optimized.
    To create a production build, use gatsby build
    ```

    The site is now running and you can visit in your browser of choice *(hopefully [Dot Browser](https://github.com/dothq/browser))* at `localhost:8000/`. If the port is different in the above message, you can substitute `:8000` for what it says above.

## 🎓 Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
